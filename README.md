# vex-spin-up
this is my code for the vex spin up 2022-2023 season

the school doesn't have any good stuff i can get so i have to save the code to the cloud and drag and drop them back into github at home
can't use git :(

we use an x drive and i made some fancy auton for that

field oriented x drive explanation here: https://github.com/elee012345/vex-stuff/tree/main/field%20oriented%20x%20drive

i have some fancy auton code that i used because x drives have the wheels vectored in an x lmao and they aren't exactly straight and don't drive the way you expect them to so check out my epic readme in that folder for that
