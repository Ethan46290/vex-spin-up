# VEX Spin Up 2022-2023

Advanced robotics code implementing field-oriented X-drive control, autonomous routines, and precision shooting systems for the VEX Robotics Competition Spin Up game.

## Key Features

- **Field-Oriented X-Drive** - Custom drivetrain implementation allowing intuitive robot control from the driver's perspective, regardless of robot orientation
- **Advanced Shooting System** - Dynamic flywheel control and auto-aim capabilities using vision sensors
- **Precise Autonomous Control** - Wheel odometry and inertial sensor fusion for accurate autonomous navigation
- **Clean Command Interface** - Simplified autonomous programming methods allowing quick routine development

## Technical Highlights

- Custom voltage-based flywheel control bypassing VEX's internal PID
- Vision-based auto-aim with PID-controlled targeting
- Trigonometry-based X-drive motion calculations
- Absolute angle turning using inertial sensors
- Comprehensive wheel odometry implementation

## Documentation

- [X-Drive Explanation](https://github.com/elee012345/vex-stuff/tree/main/field%20oriented%20x%20drive) - Detailed breakdown of field-oriented drive implementation
- [Autonomous Logic](auton%20testing/README.md) - Documentation of autonomous calculations and methods
- [Code Overview](code-explanations/code-explanation-interview.ipynb) - In-depth explanation of key systems

## Development Notes

Built using VEX V5 Pro without external libraries. All systems developed from scratch due to development environment constraints. Code is fully documented and open source for educational purposes.

this is my code for the vex spin up 2022-2023 season

the school doesn't have any good stuff i can get so i have to save the code to the cloud and drag and drop them back into github at home
can't use git :(

we use an x drive and i made some fancy auton for that

field oriented x drive explanation here: https://github.com/elee012345/vex-stuff/tree/main/field%20oriented%20x%20drive

i have some fancy auton code that i used because x drives have the wheels vectored in an x lmao and they aren't exactly straight and don't drive the way you expect them to so check out my epic readme in that folder for that

no i do not have two different accounts ethan46290 is the other programmer who has the same name as me
