    "Our robot uses an x-drive drivetrain, which, though not incredibly common, already has pretty standardized code. This drivetrain can go forward, backwards, and strafe side-to-side. Our x-drive is unique because it is field oriented; it's the closest you can get to running a swerve drive on a vex bot. Field oriented driving means that, no matter what direction the robot is facing, it goes forward relative to you/the field, not itself. So if the robot is facing left, and you tell it to go forward, it'll strafe to its right.\n",

    "Since we don't have distance sensors or a GPS sensor, our robot runs its autonomous routine based on wheel odometry. Odometry is just a fancy word for saying that we estimate the robot's position and movements based off of the degrees each wheel has turned. Combined with our inertial sensor, we've implemented easy-to-use methods that make our auton routine easy to program. \n",

    " goTo(0, 5, 1);\n",
    " ```\n",
    " Similar methods have been implemented for turning. Most important is the turnToAbsolute method. If we want the robot to turn to a very precise heading, wheel odometry can be inconsistent because of a combination of gear and motor play. Instead, we can get much more consistent results with the inertial sensor, which tells us exactly where the robot is facing. The turnToAbsolute method turns to a specified angle from 0-359, regardless of where the robot is facing when the method is called (which would be turnToRelative). By doing some fancy math, the robot calculates the fastest way to turn to the specfied angle and goes there. We don't have to worry about robot inconsistency this way, since the inertial sensor always knows where it is and where it's facing."

    "Wheel odometry isn't actually too difficult to calculate. We convert from wheel diameter and gear ratio to circumference to rotations based on how far the robot is supposed to drive, and do a few more calculations to determine the speed at which each wheel's motor should turn at per second (since we're strafing to x/y, the wheels are not necessarily turning at the same speed). The most difficult part about it is that an x-drive has wheels that are vectored outwards at 45 degrees. This means that to drive forward, we can't directly calculate how far a normal wheel would drive. By doing a little bit of trigonometry, we can solve for how much we need to scale the driving by, the square root of two. Without overcomplicating it too much, we use the special 45 45 90 triangle identity and solve for the hypotenuse."
