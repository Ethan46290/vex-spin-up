Our x-drive is unique because it is field oriented; it's the closest you can get to running a swerve drive on a vex bot. Field oriented driving means that, no matter what direction the robot is facing, it goes forward relative to you/the field, not itself. So if the robot is facing left, and you tell it to go forward, it'll strafe to its right.\n",
